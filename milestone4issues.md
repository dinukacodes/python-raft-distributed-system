# Milestone 4 Issues and Solutions

## Node Cycling Problem

### Problem Description
The system is experiencing automatic node cycling where nodes are constantly being marked as inactive and then reconnected without any user intervention. This creates an unstable cluster state where:

1. Nodes randomly become inactive
2. System automatically attempts to reconnect
3. Nodes recover only to become inactive again
4. This cycle continues indefinitely

### Root Causes

1. **Aggressive Health Checks**
   - Current heartbeat interval is too short (5 seconds)
   - Nodes are marked inactive after missing 3 heartbeats (15 seconds)
   - No grace period between health checks
   - No backoff strategy for reconnection attempts

2. **Raft Election Timeouts**
   - Election timeouts are too short (150-300ms)
   - Creates race conditions with heartbeat system
   - Triggers unnecessary leader elections
   - Causes cascading node state changes

3. **Heartbeat System Issues**
   - Heartbeat interval (5s) is much longer than election timeout (150-300ms)
   - No coordination between heartbeat and election systems
   - Missing heartbeat immediately triggers node status change
   - No consideration for temporary network issues

4. **Reconnection Logic**
   - Immediate reconnection attempts without delay
   - No exponential backoff
   - No maximum retry limit
   - Creates a cycle of disconnect/reconnect

### Impact

1. **System Stability**
   - Constant node state changes
   - Unnecessary leader elections
   - Increased network traffic
   - Potential data inconsistency

2. **Performance**
   - Increased CPU usage from constant reconnections
   - Network congestion from frequent state changes
   - Reduced system responsiveness
   - Higher latency for client requests

3. **Monitoring**
   - False alerts for node failures
   - Inaccurate cluster status reporting
   - Difficulty in identifying real issues
   - Unreliable metrics

### Required Fixes

1. **Health Check System**
   - Increase heartbeat interval to 30 seconds
   - Add 60-second grace period before marking node inactive
   - Implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Add maximum retry limit

2. **Raft Configuration**
   - Increase election timeout to 1-2 seconds
   - Add minimum time between elections
   - Implement better election coordination
   - Add leader stability period

3. **Connection Management**
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement proper connection timeouts
   - Add circuit breaker pattern
   - Better error handling for network issues

4. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Add more detailed node state logging
   - Implement proper metrics for connection attempts
   - Add health check statistics
   - Better visualization of node state changes

## Next Steps

1. Implement the fixes in order of priority:
   - Health check system improvements

   - Connection management enhancements
   - Monitoring improvements

2. Add comprehensive testing:
   - Network partition scenarios
