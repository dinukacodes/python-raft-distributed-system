Title: Designing a Fault-Tolerant Distributed File Storage System

Scenario:
Your team has been tasked with designing a distributed file storage system. The system must ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and consistency while handling concurrent read/write operations from multiple clients. The system will be deployed across multiple servers.

Tasks:
1. Fault Tolerance (Member 1):
Objective: Ensure the system can continue operating even if one or more servers fail.
Tasks:
- Design a redundancy mechanism (e.g., replication or erasure coding) to tolerate server failures.
- Implement a failure detection system to identify when a server goes offline.
- Propose a recovery mechanism to restore data and services when a failed server comes back online.
- Evaluate the trade-offs between fault tolerance and system performance.
2. Data Replication and Consistency (Member 2):
Objective: Ensure data is replicated across multiple servers while maintaining consistency.
Tasks:
- Design a replication strategy (e.g., primary-backup, multi-master, or quorum-based replication).
- Choose a consistency model (e.g., strong consistency, eventual consistency) and justify your choice.
- Implement a mechanism to handle conflicts during concurrent read/write operations.
- Evaluate the impact of replication on system performance and consistency.
3. Time Synchronization (Member 3):
Objective: Ensure all servers in the system have synchronized clocks for consistent operations.
Tasks:
- Research and implement a time synchronization protocol (e.g., NTP or PTP) to synchronize clocks across servers.
- Analyze the impact of clock skew on system operations (e.g., ordering of events, consistency).
- Propose a mechanism to handle scenarios where time synchronization fails.
- Evaluate the trade-offs between synchronization accuracy and system overhead.
4. Consensus and Agreement Algorithms (Member 4):
Objective: Ensure all servers agree on the state of the system, even in the presence of failures.
Tasks:
- Research and implement a consensus algorithm (e.g., Paxos, Raft, or Zab) to achieve agreement among servers.
- Design a mechanism to handle leader election in case the current leader fails.
- Evaluate the performance of the consensus algorithm under different failure scenarios.
- Propose optimizations to reduce the overhead of achieving consensus.
- Test the system under different scenarios such as server failures and network partitions.

Deliverables:
1. Report:
   - A detailed report (10-12 pages) explaining the design choices, algorithms, and mechanisms used for each task. Include the test results conducted and include a discussion of the results. 

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Fault Tolerance:
   - How well does the system handle server failures?
   - Is the recovery mechanism effective?
2. Data Replication and Consistency:
   - Does the system maintain consistency during concurrent operations?
   - How does replication impact performance?
3. Time Synchronization:
   - Are the serversâ€™ clocks synchronized accurately?
   - How does the system handle clock skew?
4. Consensus and Agreement:
   - Does the system achieve consensus reliably?
   - How does the consensus algorithm perform under failures?
5. Overall Integration:
   - Do all components work together seamlessly?
   - Is the system scalable and efficient?

Submission Guidelines:
- Include a README file with the names, registration numbers and emails of the members and the instructions for running the prototype.
